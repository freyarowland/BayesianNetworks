# Bayesian Belief Network Analysis Proposal

This is a very empty GitHub page that will grow as we develop the project.

## Contributors
- Freya Rowland
- Chris Kotalik
- David Walters

## Software
Still TBD. Deciding between open-source [BNlearn](<https://www.bnlearn.com/>) or more user-friendly (but ~$700) [Netica](<https://www.norsys.com/netica.html>)

## Phase I: comprehensive literature review and development of guidelines for best practices in building BNs

## Phase II: Bayesian Network on Hg flux with a finished NRDAR Case

### Sites to consider

[Pickle Pond in Minnesota](<https://stlouisriverestuary.org/restoration_picklepond.php#:~:text=Pickle%20Pond%20is%20a%20shallow%2C%20sheltered%20bay-like%20site,biological%20diversity%20and%20create%20a%20functional%20wetland.%20History>) is a EPA GLRI site where partners have expressed interest in understanding flux of contaminants to birds.

[South River in Virginia](<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.7b02577#:~:text=Historic%20point%20source%20mercury%20%28Hg%29%20contamination%20from%20industrial,elevated%20Hg%20concentrations%20persist%20in%20the%20river%20system.>) has long-term data on Hg

[Mobile River in Alabama](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420320872?via%3Dihub>) was one of Sarah Jannsen's projects.

Also open to other ideas.


## To do list

- [ ] Test both types of software
- [ ] Pick a site for case study
- [ ] Make sure our proposal doesn't overlap too much with [Wayne Landis](<https://wp.wwu.edu/toxicology/faculty-staff/dr-wayne-g-landis/>)
