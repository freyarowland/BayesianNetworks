# Bayesian Belief Network Analysis Proposal

This is a very empty GitHub page that will grow as we develop the project. An example of a more developed GitHub page is [here](<https://github.com/freyarowland/WoodFrogCode>)

## Software

Comparing open-source [BNlearn](<https://www.bnlearn.com/>) and more user-friendly (but ~$700) [Netica](<https://www.norsys.com/netica.html>) BN learn has a [shiny app](<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesianNetwork/vignettes/BayesianNetwork.html>) that is very well developed. 

Netica can also interface with a [shiny app](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136481521930221X>)

## Phase I: comprehensive literature review and development of guidelines for best practices in building BNs

## Phase II: Bayesian Network on Hg flux with a finished NRDAR Case

### Sites to consider

[Pickle Pond in Minnesota](<https://stlouisriverestuary.org/restoration_picklepond.php#:~:text=Pickle%20Pond%20is%20a%20shallow%2C%20sheltered%20bay-like%20site,biological%20diversity%20and%20create%20a%20functional%20wetland.%20History>) is a EPA GLRI site where partners have expressed interest in understanding flux of contaminants to birds.
- Advantage: May help the EPA GLRI group in their flux to bird questions
- Disadvantage: Unknown to ORDA and so probably won't be exciting to ORDA folks.

[South River in Virginia](<https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.7b02577#:~:text=Historic%20point%20source%20mercury%20%28Hg%29%20contamination%20from%20industrial,elevated%20Hg%20concentrations%20persist%20in%20the%20river%20system.>) has long-term data on Hg.
- Advantage: Well-established system
- Disadvantage: has already been tapped for a BN by Wayne Landis' student.

[Mobile River in Alabama](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389420320872?via%3Dihub>) was one of Sarah Jannsen's projects.
- Advantage: well-known NRDAR site with lots of Hg data
- Disadvantage: case manager may be tapped out.

[Pompton Lakes](<https://archive.epa.gov/epa/newsreleases/epa-directs-dupont-remove-mercury-pompton-lake-pompton-lakes-new-jersey.html>) was suggested by Jo and is our currently front runner.
- Advantage: Pompton Lakes is a Hg site and case team has several bird studies. Case manager is new and may have more bandwidth. 
- Disadvantages: none?

## To do list

- [ ] Test both types of software
- [ ] Make sure our proposal doesn't overlap too much with [Wayne Landis](<https://wp.wwu.edu/toxicology/faculty-staff/dr-wayne-g-landis/>)
