## Contributors
- Freya Rowland
- Chris Kotalik

## Software
Still TBD. Deciding between open-source [BNlearn](<https://www.bnlearn.com/>) or more user-friendly (but ~$700) [Netica](<https://www.norsys.com/netica.html>)

## Sites to consider

[Pickle Pond](<https://stlouisriverestuary.org/restoration_picklepond.php#:~:text=Pickle%20Pond%20is%20a%20shallow%2C%20sheltered%20bay-like%20site,biological%20diversity%20and%20create%20a%20functional%20wetland.%20History>) is a EPA GLRI site where partners have expressed interest in understanding flux of contaminants to birds.

[Smith River in Virginia](<https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1154082?casa_token=itpI-KDgiiAAAAAA%3AifU051F78DCdlBGy2w1kXs9QK9Pat6ucm7GU2UrEJS-Td630neOL1samAUQDHJOEsu4XFerEctdcs9c>) has long-term data and a Science pub anchoring the data on flux to birds.

### To do list
